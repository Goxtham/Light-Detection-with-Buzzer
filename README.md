# Light-Detection-with-Buzzer
This project was made with the aim of detecting light every 20 seconds and turning on buzzer if there is or there isn't light in the room followed by alert messages to the owner through sms and email. This project would be helpful for agricultural purposes (especially indoor agriculture/greenhouse farming etc) as plants need sunlight to grow and this device can detect whether the plant is getting sufficient sunlight and if not send alerts to the owner. It can also be used for security purposes as it can detect whether there is or there isn't light in the room.
